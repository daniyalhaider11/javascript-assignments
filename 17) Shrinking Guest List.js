// QUESTION: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. 
// Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. 
// Each time you pop a name from your list, 
// Print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. 
// Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

// AWNSER:

let guests = ["Hammad", "Muneeb", "Tehreem", "Ghazal"];
console.log("I can only invite two peoples now");
console.log(`I am sorry, I can't invite you ${guests.pop()}`);
console.log(`I am sorry, I can't invite you ${guests.pop()}`);
console.log(`I am sorry, I can't invite you ${guests.pop()}`);
guests.map((name) =>
console.log(`Dear ${name}, have for you dinner with me.`)
);
guests.pop();
guests.pop();
console.log("Guest List: ", guests);
